## Description
The ultimate goal here is to learn about Robotics and be able to build an autonomous DRONE in the future. We started this DRONE project ***(Valkyrie UAV)*** in our university PUC-Campinas and, now, we're advancing in the studies of the operating system.

## Features
**ROBOT MODEL**

INSERT GIF

This is the initial model of the robot: a simple robot car. Through the process, we learned how to create and modify the characteristics of our project from zero in **ROS**. In this example, we're using **Gazebo** to simulate all the code.

**CAMERAS**

We are using two cameras, back and front, to get images in real time of the simulation world.

**RPLIDAR**

INSERT GIF

As you can see, the RPlidar is a few centimeters above the ground and can provide the information of obstacles in its radius (can be configured to a specific range). One example of this configuration would be a robot car that can monitor the aisles of a supermarket and inform if an item needs to be replenished.
